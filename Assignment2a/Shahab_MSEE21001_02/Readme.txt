I made two .py files i.e. for task 1 and task 2
open each for the results

>>>Place the train and test folders in Shahab_MSEE21001_02/Data  (note that Data is case sensitive dont use data)
>>>open the directory Shahab_MSEE21001_02 directory in vscode.
>>>open MSEE21001_Task1_02.py  for task 1 and run the file
>>>open MSEE21001_Task2_02.py  for task 2 and run the file

>>>the code can be run in jupyter style (i did this to avoid reloading the data again and again)
>>>the code can be run in one go by deleting the (# %%) in the code (# %% makes the .py file run like jupyter ie in cells)
